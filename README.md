Coursyl
=======

Coursyl is a Rails app originally developed to manage <b>cour</b>se <b>syl</b>labi.  Over time, it expanded to include:

* Student logins
* Assignment taking
* Assignment grading (including anonymity!)
* Grade forecasting
* Lesson planning
* Media/link repositories
* Visual, topic-based trees
* Class meeting management
* Student feedback
* Achievement-based grading

This repository updates some of the functions of the HTML in the course grade threshold view with javascript functions to improve the update button and display of the adding of grade thresholds.
